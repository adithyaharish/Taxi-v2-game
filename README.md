# Taxi-v2-game
Using Reinforcement learning to implement Taxi-v2 game (simulating self drive cars)

The main purpose of this project is to illustrate how to apply RL 
approaches to construct an efficient and safe solution to solving the Taxi-v2 game in a simplified 
context. The Smart cab's job is to pick up and drop off passengers at different locations. Q-learning is implemented.
